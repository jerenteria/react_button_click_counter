# Hello and Welcome to my click counter React App 

### I Created this app to get a better understanding about useState() and how it works.
### useState is a react hook that allows you to change an object by updating it from its old state to its new state.
### This allows for a better user experience because now the user wont have to wait for unnecessary rendering
